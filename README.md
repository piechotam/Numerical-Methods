# Numerical Methods Project

## Description
A project for Numerical Methods course, a part of Data Science Bachelor Engineering Programme at Warsaw University of Technology.
The goal of this project was to implement a method for solving system of linear equations, $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a five-diagonal matrix, an example of sparse matrix.
Implemented method uses the fact that most of matrix entries are zero and solves system much faster then MATLAB built-in function. The details of time comparison are in the paper.

## Contents
Project consists of MATLAB scripts created for solving linear system using modified Gaussian method, calculating matrix determinant and a scientific paper, written in latex, that describes theory and details of the project.
Paper is currently in Polish, but I hope to translate it to English in near future.
